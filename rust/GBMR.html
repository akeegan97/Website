                                <p>The cornerstone of this project is the application of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for predicting stock prices. GBM, a pivotal model in finance, stems from Brownian Motion—a continuous stochastic process known for its relevance in modeling erratic behaviors. The unique characteristic of GBM, as employed in financial modeling, lies in its confinement of outcomes within the range [0, +∞), effectively ensuring no negative values. This is particularly manifested in the GBM formula: dS(t) = μS(t)dt + σS(t)dW(t), where the resolution of this stochastic differential equation is S(t) = S(0) exp((μ - 1/2 σ²)t + σε), which served as the basis for simulating diverse stock price trajectories.</p>
                                <p>In its resolved state, S(t) = S(0) exp((μ - 1/2 σ²)t + σε), with μ representing the drift (indicative of the trend) and σ the volatility (indicating the degree of spread or risk). The process to deduce these parameters involved analyzing the natural logarithm of returns to ascertain the mean (μ) and variance (σ) from historical data. The term ε is derived through random sampling from a normal distribution, centered at zero and with a standard deviation scaled by √Δt, where Δt equates to the reciprocal of the number of intervals. This method presumes a static distribution of log returns over time, allowing only the numerical price to fluctuate.</p>

                                    Building upon my prior work in Python, I seized the opportunity to harness Rust's powerful features to enhance the project. The objective was to develop a standalone executable capable of processing financial data from Yahoo directly, streamlining simulations without the need for source code adjustments. For this task, I turned to EGUI, a Rust crate familiar from a past project, chosen for its versatility in compiling to both native and web applications through WebAssembly (WASM).

                                    The application greets users with a straightforward interface upon launch, depicted in Figure 1. It allows for the selection of a CSV file to feed into the simulation, along with parameters such as the training data's start and end dates, the prediction date, and the preferred price type, enabling a customized simulation experience.

Highlighted are 50 simulated price paths, a balance between performance and visualization, though the software accommodates up to a billion paths. The computational efficiency is noteworthy, with a billion predictions completed in around five seconds on my setup, though performance may vary based on CPU capacity.

                                        This project marked my inaugural venture into Rust, transitioning from an initial Python implementation. 
                                        The journey not only allowed me to appreciate Rust's robust performance and safety features but also provided a 
                                        hands-on experience with its distinct paradigms and syntax nuances. As a direct rewrite from Python, it served as a 
                                        practical exploration into adapting familiar logic to Rust's ownership model and type system, revealing the language's 
                                        potential to elevate the project's efficiency and scalability.

                                        Acknowledging the project's current state, I recognize numerous opportunities for performance optimization. 
                                        Future revisions will focus on minimizing unnecessary vector copies by leveraging references and employing more 
                                        efficient data structures. For instance, replacing vectors with slices where possible could reduce overhead, and 
                                        exploring the use of `HashMap` or `BTreeMap` for organizing paths might offer quicker access and manipulation based on 
                                        specific criteria. Such improvements aim to refine the application's execution speed and memory usage, further harnessing Rust's 
                                        capability to manage resources effectively.

                                        In summary, this project not only served as a meaningful introduction to Rust but also underscored the 
                                        importance of continual learning and iteration in software development. The transition from Python highlighted 
                                        Rust's unique advantages and challenges, setting the stage for further exploration and optimization. As I look 
                                        forward to enhancing the project with more sophisticated data structures and efficient coding practices, I remain 
                                        excited about the possibilities that Rust offers for future projects.
