							<p>This project revolved around the use of Geometric Brownian Motion to forecast stock prices. Brownian Motion is a continuous stochastic differential equation 
								that has useful properties in modeling random processes. In this application a specific subset of Brownian Motion was used: Geometric Brownian Motion. 
								GBM has applications in finance since by design the output of the function is bounded as [0, +∞), such that there are no negative values given. The equation of 
								Geometric Brownian Motion is given by dS(t)= μS(t)dt+ σS(t)dW(t), solving the stochastic differential equation yields S(t)=S(0)  exp⁡((μ-1/2 σ^2 )t+σε. This is the equation that I used 
								in order to simulate price paths of several different stocks. 
                            </p>
							<p>In the solved form, S(t)=S(0)  exp⁡((μ-1/2 σ^2 )t+σε, μ is the drift and σ is the diffusion, these parameters measure the trend and the potential spread respectively. 
								Estimating the two parameters can be done in any number of ways, the option I used was taking the natural log of returns to find the expected value (μ) and the variance (σ) of 
								observed returns. The error term ε is estimated by taking a random selection from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of √Δt, 
								where Δt  is one divided by the step size. The underlying assumption with this approach to estimating μ and σ is that the stock’s distribution of log returns is constant through time, 
								with only the numerical price changing.

                                Since I had completed this project before in Python, I wanted to use Rust’s capabilities to expand my previous version. I wanted to create a standalone executable that I could drop financial data
                                from Yahoo into and run simulations on with no editing of source code. I started by using a Rust crate called EGUI, which I had previous experience using for another 
                                project and decided it would be the perfect library to use as it can compile to a native or web app using WASM. 
                            </p>

                                Figure 1 shows the application on start up with the various options presented to the user. The user can select a csv file for the simulation.
                                Once the user selects the file, specifies the training data start and end dates, chooses the prediction date, and the price type to use they can run the simulation.

                                Figure 2 shows the application after a simulation has been completed. At the top the values used in the equation are displayed, along with the simulation's accuracy
                                and the real price recorded on the day and the predicted price from the simulation. Below that are 50 simulated price paths calculated with the equation and displayed. 
                                To save performance only 50 are displayed while the above data is calculated from the user specified path number which can be between 1 and 1 billion. On my machine the
                                application takes approximately 5 seconds to complete a billion predicted prices, however since it's very CPU sensitive results on other machines will vary.
