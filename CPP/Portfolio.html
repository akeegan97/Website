			<h2 class="major">Design Decisions and Code Highlights</h2>
			<h3>Smart Pointer Usage</h3>
			<p>One of the key design decisions was the use of <code>shared_ptrs&lt;T&gt;</code> to manage the relationship between Investors, Positions, and Assets. 
				This choice ensured automatic memory management, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers, especially important in the context of a complex application 
				managing numerous financial entities. Below is an example demonstrating this approach:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
	// Example of using shared_ptrs for resource management
	std::shared_ptr&lt;Asset&gt; asset = std::make_shared&lt;Asset&gt;("AssetName");
	std::shared_ptr&lt;Investor&gt; investor = std::make_shared&lt;Investor&gt;();
	std::shared_ptr&lt;Position&gt; position = std::make_shared&lt;Position&gt;();
	position-&gt;SetInvestorPtr(investor);
	position-&gt;SetAssetPtr(asset);
	investor-&gt;AddPosition(position);
	asset-&gt;AddPosition(position);
	</code></pre>
	<p>This approach simplifies memory management, allowing the application to automatically handle the lifecycle of assets without manual intervention. As well as safely using the 
		features of pointers without the pitfalls that come with using raw pointers.</p>
	<h3>Custom Templates</h3>
	<p>Another key to expanding wxWidgets' capabilities was to derive a custom class for a virtual list ctrl instead of using the default wxListCtrl</p>
	<pre><code>
	class CustomControlBase{
	public:
		virtual bool IsVListCtrl()const{return false;}
		virtual ~CustomControlBase(){}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper {
		static const T&amp; deref(const T&amp; item) {
			return item;
		}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
		static const T&amp; deref(const std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; item) {
			return *item;
		}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
		static const T&amp; deref(const std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; item) {
			return *item;
		}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper&lt;T*&gt; {
		static const T&amp; deref(T* const&amp; item) {
			return *item;
		}
	};
template &lt;typename T&gt;
	class VListControl : public wxListCtrl, public CustomControlBase {
	private:
		using UnderlyingType = std::remove_reference_t&lt;decltype(DerefHelper&lt;T&gt::deref(std::declval&lt;T&gt()))&gt;
	public:
		VListControl(wxWindow *parent, const wxWindowID id, const wxPoint &pos, const wxSize &size)
		: wxListCtrl(parent, id, pos, size, wxLC_REPORT | wxLC_VIRTUAL){}};
	</code></pre>
	<p>Extending wxWidgets wxListCtrl to be a custom templated class allows the use of "items" that are of shared_ptr type,
		meaning when interacting with a specific item changing that item's properties flows to all of the other objects that reference 
		that item. For example in AssetPopout if you interact with a specific valuation or distribution and change the date or amount that will 
		automatically flow to the asset without explicitly removing the old object, creating a new one, and pushing that new one to the appropriate place.

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->

            <h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				The Portfolio Application has successfully transitioned to production, demonstrating its efficacy in 
				ensuring data consistency and the accuracy of financial calculations, thereby obviating the need for 
				multiple Excel workbooks that were prone to oversight and errors in client statements. By centralizing 
				critical fund information, the application streamlines data verification processes and enhances the speed 
				and efficiency of retrieving specific details about assets, investors, and positions as required.
			</p>
			<p>
				From the development and deployment of the Portfolio Application, several valuable lessons emerged, encapsulating a broad spectrum of software engineering principles and practices. 
				These insights not only enhanced the project's efficiency and reliability but also provided a solid foundation for future development endeavors. Here's a summary touching upon the specified topics:<br>
				<br>
				1.	CMake for Building: CMake proved instrumental in streamlining the build process across different platforms. It facilitated the creation of a versatile build environment 
				that could adapt to varying operating system requirements, demonstrating the importance of a powerful, cross-platform build system in modern software development.<br>
				<br>
				2.	Apple App Bundle and Windows Development: Packaging the application for macOS as an App Bundle and adapting it for Windows highlighted the nuances of platform-specific 
				distribution. This experience underscored the necessity of understanding the ecosystem and deployment standards of each target platform to ensure seamless installation and user experience.<br>
				<br>
				3.	Static and Dynamically Linked Libraries: The project's exploration of both static and dynamically linked libraries shed light on the distinct trade-offs associated with 
				each linking method, ultimately influencing a pivotal decision in the development process. Initially, the project embarked on a path toward dynamic linking, attracted by the 
				benefits of reduced application size and the facilitation of smoother updates. However, as development progressed, the advantages of static linking—particularly its contribution to easier 
				deployment and consistency across different environments—became increasingly apparent. This realization led to a strategic pivot towards static linking as the preferred method. 
				The choice to opt for static linking was driven by the paramount importance of simplifying distribution, ensuring that end-users could access and use the application with minimal setup requirements. 
				This decision underscored the necessity of adaptability in software development, as well as the importance of selecting technologies and methodologies that best align with the project's overarching goals, 
				especially in terms of deployment and user experience.<br>
				<br>
				4.	Modern C++ Standards: Employing modern C++ features such as shared_ptrs, std::remove_reference_t, and various STL methods (sort, emplace, pop_back, swap, iterators) not 
				only facilitated safer memory management and more efficient data manipulation but also made the code more readable and maintainable. These practices emphasized the benefits of 
				staying current with evolving language standards to leverage new capabilities and idioms.<br>
				<br>
				5.	Proper Class Setups: The project reinforced the importance of encapsulation in object-oriented design, utilizing private member variables with public setters and getters. 
				This approach ensured data integrity and abstraction, allowing for more controlled access and manipulation of class data. The experience validated the principles of encapsulation 
				and the significance of designing classes with clear interfaces and restricted access to their internal state.<br>
				<br>
				Overall, the Portfolio Application project served as a comprehensive exercise in applying and integrating various software development practices and C++ programming techniques. 
				The lessons learned from navigating cross-platform development challenges, leveraging modern C++ features, and adhering to sound design principles have not only improved the 
				application's quality but also enriched my expertise. <br>
				<br>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is in ongoing development, evolving in response to user feedback. This adaptability underscores a significant benefit of custom applications: the ease of 
				incorporating new or requested features into subsequent updates, ensuring the application continuously meets and exceeds user needs.
