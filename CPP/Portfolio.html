				<span class="image fit"><img src ="../images/rugenberg_mainframe.jpg" alt=""/></span>
			<P>
			Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a meticulously designed main landing page that encapsulates the essence of the fund's 
			operations and its financial landscape. This interface is intuitively organized into three primary sections, each offering unique insights into the fund's performance and composition:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Asset Holdings Display: A VListCtrl component elegantly presents the fund's asset holdings, allowing users to easily browse and understand the diverse investments 
					that constitute the fund's portfolio. This visual representation not only provides a comprehensive overview of asset types and allocations but also enhances transparency 
					and investor confidence.
				</li>
				<li>
					Investor Overview: Another VListCtrl is dedicated to showcasing the investors within the fund, offering a clear view of the participating entities or individuals. 
					This segment is crucial for understanding the fund's backing and the confidence placed in it by its investors, reflecting the fund's credibility and appeal in the 
					financial market.
				</li>
				<li>
					Valuation Chart: The financial valuation of the fund over time is beautifully illustrated in a chart, segmented by quarters. 
					This visualization aids in tracking the fund's performance, highlighting trends, growth patterns, and potential areas for strategic adjustments. 
					It serves as a vital tool for investors and fund managers alike, facilitating informed decision-making based on historical data and projections.
				</li>
			</ul>
			Together, these elements combine to form a powerful dashboard that not only serves as the operational hub for users but also underscores the application's commitment to clarity, detail, and user engagement.

			<p>
				This application incorporates a preprocessor directive tailored for WXMAC, ensuring that the user interface maintains a 
				consistent aesthetic across both macOS and Windows environments. This adjustment is particularly necessary due to wxWidgets' 
				ability to provide a native widget feel, which can lead to discrepancies under different system settings, such as night mode. By 
				implementing specific styling directives, the application guarantees a uniform user experience, regardless of the operating system preferences or settings.
				</p>
				<p>
				Within the application's mainframe, users are presented with a variety of actions and choices that enhance their interaction with the fund's operations. 
				Among these options is the ability to add a new investor to the fund, as well as the incorporation of new assets. When introducing a new asset, users are prompted to
				 designate an initial investor, marking the commencement of capital deployment into the asset. Should an individual not be selected during this process, 
				 the application defaults to assigning a "Fund" position. This approach facilitates the initial use of general fund capital for asset acquisition, 
				 which can subsequently be allocated to individual investors in a component-based arrangement. This flexibility supports dynamic investment strategies and fund management, 
				 ensuring that users can efficiently manage and expand the fund's portfolio.
				</p>
			<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/rugenberg_add_newasset.jpg" alt=""/></span>
			<p>Beyond the available buttons, interaction with the application is further enriched by the capability to right-click or double left-click on a row within the asset VListCtrl, 
				triggering an 'asset pop-out' view. Similarly, engaging in these actions within the investor VListCtrl opens an 'investor pop-out' view. Each of these pop-out views offers 
				detailed insights and functionalities specific to the selected asset or investor, enhancing the user's navigational and operational experience within the application.</p>
			<h3>Asset Popout</h3>
			<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/rugenberg_assetpopout.jpg" alt=""/></span>
			<p>
				Upon selecting a row in the asset VListCtrl through either a right-click or a double left-click, users are directed to the asset's main control panel. This interface is the 
				central hub for managing a specific asset within the fund, designed to streamline and simplify asset administration.<br>
				<br>
				Within this panel, users have access to a variety of actions, facilitated by four distinct buttons. These buttons are labeled for specific operations: 
				initiating a distribution, updating asset valuation, adding a new position, and reallocating funds between deployable and reserved capital. Each action is designed to
				enhance the asset's management process, allowing for efficient and effective fund operation.<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, the asset popout view displays critical statistics related to the asset, such as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the total number of investors, as 
				well as deployed and reserved capital amounts among others. This comprehensive overview provides users with immediate access to key financial metrics and asset details, 
				enabling informed decision-making and strategic asset management.<br>
			</p>
			<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/rugenberg_addposition_component.jpg" alt=""/></span>
			<p>
				Included is an illustrative example showcasing the process of adding a new component position. This procedure intricately links the position to a selected investor. 
				The committed amount for this new position is determined by aggregating the available amounts from existing positions, as displayed on the right side of the interface, 
				where each position's available capital is listed.<br><br>

				For instance, if the entire $250,000 available from the fund's position is allocated to this new component, it triggers a capital movement event. 
				This results in the fund's position being adjusted to a zero balance in its committed amount and percentage ownership for this particular asset. 
				Such a scenario effectively signifies the fund's own capital exit from this asset, illustrating the dynamic nature of fund management and the 
				strategic reallocation of capital within the application.			
			</p>
			<h3>Investor Popout</h3>
			<span class="image fit"><img src ="../images/rugenberg_investorpopout.jpg" alt=""/></span>
			<p>
				Upon interacting with the investor VListCtrl on the main frame, users are navigated to a detailed display page dedicated to showcasing specific investor information. 
				Currently, this page is designed purely for display purposes, without interactive functionalities for the user.<br>
				<br>
				At the forefront, a VListCtrl panel spans the top of the page, aggregating and presenting data on assets in which the investor holds stakes. 
				To enhance clarity and simplicity, positions held in the same asset are consolidated, appearing as a single row in the display. Adjacent to this, a 
				wxAuiNotebook serves as a comprehensive ledger, itemizing the distinct assets associated with the investor, alongside records of distributions received, 
				management fees due or paid, and performance fees accrued from each position.<br>
				<br>
				This segment of the application stands as a focal point for ongoing enhancements. Future updates are anticipated to introduce functionalities such as an 
				'export to CSV/PDF' feature, aimed at streamlining the generation of quarterly statements for clients, further enriching the user experience and the application's 
				utility.

	<!-- Design Decisions Section -->
	<section id="design" class="wrapper">
		<div class="inner">
			<h1 class="major">Design Decisions and Code Highlights</h2>
			<h3>Smart Pointer Usage</h3>
			<p>One of the key design decisions was the use of <code>shared_ptrs&lt;T&gt;</code> to manage the relationship between Investors, Positions, and Assets. 
				This choice ensured automatic memory management, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers, especially important in the context of a complex application 
				managing numerous financial entities. Below is an example demonstrating this approach:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
	// Example of using shared_ptrs for resource management
	std::shared_ptr&lt;Asset&gt; asset = std::make_shared&lt;Asset&gt;("AssetName");
	std::shared_ptr&lt;Investor&gt; investor = std::make_shared&lt;Investor&gt;();
	std::shared_ptr&lt;Position&gt; position = std::make_shared&lt;Position&gt;();
	position-&gt;SetInvestorPtr(investor);
	position-&gt;SetAssetPtr(asset);
	investor-&gt;AddPosition(position);
	asset-&gt;AddPosition(position);
	</code></pre>
	<p>This approach simplifies memory management, allowing the application to automatically handle the lifecycle of assets without manual intervention. As well as safely using the 
		features of pointers without the pitfalls that come with using raw pointers.</p>
	<h3>Custom Templates</h3>
	<p>Another key to expanding wxWidgets' capabilities was to derive a custom class for a virtual list ctrl instead of using the default wxListCtrl</p>
	<pre><code>
	class CustomControlBase{
	public:
		virtual bool IsVListCtrl()const{return false;}
		virtual ~CustomControlBase(){}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper {
		static const T&amp; deref(const T&amp; item) {
			return item;
		}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
		static const T&amp; deref(const std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; item) {
			return *item;
		}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
		static const T&amp; deref(const std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; item) {
			return *item;
		}
	};
	
	template&lt;typename T&gt;
	struct DerefHelper&lt;T*&gt; {
		static const T&amp; deref(T* const&amp; item) {
			return *item;
		}
	};
template &lt;typename T&gt;
	class VListControl : public wxListCtrl, public CustomControlBase {
	private:
		using UnderlyingType = std::remove_reference_t&lt;decltype(DerefHelper&lt;T&gt::deref(std::declval&lt;T&gt()))&gt;
	public:
		VListControl(wxWindow *parent, const wxWindowID id, const wxPoint &pos, const wxSize &size)
		: wxListCtrl(parent, id, pos, size, wxLC_REPORT | wxLC_VIRTUAL){}};
	</code></pre>
	<p>Extending wxWidgets wxListCtrl to be a custom templated class allows the use of "items" that are of shared_ptr type,
		meaning when interacting with a specific item changing that item's properties flows to all of the other objects that reference 
		that item. For example in AssetPopout if you interact with a specific valuation or distribution and change the date or amount that will 
		automatically flow to the asset without explicitly removing the old object, creating a new one, and pushing that new one to the appropriate place.

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section id="conclusion" class="wrapper">
        <div class="inner">
            <h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				The Portfolio Application has successfully transitioned to production, demonstrating its efficacy in 
				ensuring data consistency and the accuracy of financial calculations, thereby obviating the need for 
				multiple Excel workbooks that were prone to oversight and errors in client statements. By centralizing 
				critical fund information, the application streamlines data verification processes and enhances the speed 
				and efficiency of retrieving specific details about assets, investors, and positions as required.
			</p>
			<p>
				From the development and deployment of the Portfolio Application, several valuable lessons emerged, encapsulating a broad spectrum of software engineering principles and practices. 
				These insights not only enhanced the project's efficiency and reliability but also provided a solid foundation for future development endeavors. Here's a summary touching upon the specified topics:<br>
				<br>
				1.	CMake for Building: CMake proved instrumental in streamlining the build process across different platforms. It facilitated the creation of a versatile build environment 
				that could adapt to varying operating system requirements, demonstrating the importance of a powerful, cross-platform build system in modern software development.<br>
				<br>
				2.	Apple App Bundle and Windows Development: Packaging the application for macOS as an App Bundle and adapting it for Windows highlighted the nuances of platform-specific 
				distribution. This experience underscored the necessity of understanding the ecosystem and deployment standards of each target platform to ensure seamless installation and user experience.<br>
				<br>
				3.	Static and Dynamically Linked Libraries: The project's exploration of both static and dynamically linked libraries shed light on the distinct trade-offs associated with 
				each linking method, ultimately influencing a pivotal decision in the development process. Initially, the project embarked on a path toward dynamic linking, attracted by the 
				benefits of reduced application size and the facilitation of smoother updates. However, as development progressed, the advantages of static linking—particularly its contribution to easier 
				deployment and consistency across different environments—became increasingly apparent. This realization led to a strategic pivot towards static linking as the preferred method. 
				The choice to opt for static linking was driven by the paramount importance of simplifying distribution, ensuring that end-users could access and use the application with minimal setup requirements. 
				This decision underscored the necessity of adaptability in software development, as well as the importance of selecting technologies and methodologies that best align with the project's overarching goals, 
				especially in terms of deployment and user experience.<br>
				<br>
				4.	Modern C++ Standards: Employing modern C++ features such as shared_ptrs, std::remove_reference_t, and various STL methods (sort, emplace, pop_back, swap, iterators) not 
				only facilitated safer memory management and more efficient data manipulation but also made the code more readable and maintainable. These practices emphasized the benefits of 
				staying current with evolving language standards to leverage new capabilities and idioms.<br>
				<br>
				5.	Proper Class Setups: The project reinforced the importance of encapsulation in object-oriented design, utilizing private member variables with public setters and getters. 
				This approach ensured data integrity and abstraction, allowing for more controlled access and manipulation of class data. The experience validated the principles of encapsulation 
				and the significance of designing classes with clear interfaces and restricted access to their internal state.<br>
				<br>
				Overall, the Portfolio Application project served as a comprehensive exercise in applying and integrating various software development practices and C++ programming techniques. 
				The lessons learned from navigating cross-platform development challenges, leveraging modern C++ features, and adhering to sound design principles have not only improved the 
				application's quality but also enriched my expertise. <br>
				<br>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is in ongoing development, evolving in response to user feedback. This adaptability underscores a significant benefit of custom applications: the ease of 
				incorporating new or requested features into subsequent updates, ensuring the application continuously meets and exceeds user needs.
