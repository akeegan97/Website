							<h1 class="major">What is Geometric Brownian Motion?</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Geometric Brownian Motion equation.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This project revolved around the use of Geometric Brownian motion to forecast stock prices. Brownian motion is a continuous stochastic differential equation 
								that has useful properties in modeling random processes. In this application a specific subset of Brownian motion was used: Geometric Brownian motion. 
								GBM has applications in finance since by design the output of the function is bounded as [0, +∞), such that there are no negative values given. The equation of 
								Geometric Brownian motion is given by dS(t)= μS(t)dt+ σS(t)dB(t), solving the SDE yields S(t)=S(0)  exp⁡((μ-1/2 σ^2 )t+σB(t)). This is the equation that I used 
								in order to simulate price paths of several different stocks. </p>
							<p>In the solved form, S(t)=S(0)  exp⁡((μ-1/2 σ^2 )t+σB(t)), μ is the drift and σ is the diffusion, these parameters measure the trend and the potential spread respectively. 
								Estimating the two parameters can be done in any number of ways, the option I used was taking the natural log of returns to find the expected value (μ) and the variance (σ) of 
								observed returns. The stochastic term B(t) is estimated by taking a random selection from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of square root Δt, 
								where Δt  is one divided by the step size. The underlying assumption with this approach to estimating μ and σ is that the stock’s distribution of log returns is constant through time, 
								with only the numerical price changing.  </p>

							<h1 class="major">Forecasting with GBM</h1>
							<p>In Python I created a function that could take parameters and would return a graph with the simulated Geometric Brownian motion price paths for a stock, a histogram of the 
								final predicted price of the simulated paths, the mean predicted price, the starting price, and the actual price on the forecasted date. Figures #{whatever} &{whatever} shows 
								the function that I defined. The parameters are scaled to the time frame that the forecast is predicting for. This is done by multiplying μ with the number of steps and σ by the square root of 
								the number of steps, steps are defined as the number of trading days that the price was specified to be predicted for. Doing this scales the parameters in a manner that is usable in predictions 
								that are further than one trading day as the μ and σ that are originally estimated are in daily units.</p>
							<p>I primarily used BAC stock data to test and analyze the model’s accuracy and to see what the number of days that produced the best results, however I also used OMCL and BTC (Bitcoin) for personal curiosity. 
								Figure #{whatever} shows the resulting graph for a time step of {} and all of the simulated paths as well as the true price path that was observed. Figure #{whatever} shows the histogram of predicted values at 
								t = steps as well as the actual value on that date.  </p>
