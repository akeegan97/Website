							<p>This mini-project marks my foray into programming with C. The game begins by selecting a random word from an 
								accompanying text file to serve as the secret word for the player to guess. When launched, the terminal-based game prompts 
								for the player's name, personalizing the game experience through customized messages. Upon successful word guess, players 
								are given the choice to either play another round with a new random word or exit. A graceful exit message thanks the player 
								by name, enhancing the game's interactive feel.</p>

							<p>The code initiates with setting up the program's fundamental parameters, including the maximum number of lines 
								and the maximum length of each word to efficiently manage the content of the "words.txt" file. It commences with a warm 
								welcome message and requests the player's name. Following this, the program opens the "words.txt" file, iterating through each 
								line to populate a character array with potential secret words. A random selection mechanism then chooses a word from this array to act as 
								the game's secret word (SW), setting the stage for an engaging round of Hangman.</p>
							<pre><code>
#include< stdlib.h >
#include< stdio.h >
#include< time.h >
#include< string.h >
#define MAXLINES 1050
#define MAXLEN 100

	char data[MAXLINES][MAXLINES];

	while(!feof(file) && !ferror(file))
		if(fgets(data[line],MAXLEN,file)!= NULL)

	int SECRET_NUMBER = rand()%1000;
	SW = data[SECRET_NUMBER];
	//random int to get a random index on the char array to use as the word
										
	//need the length of the SECRET_WORD so that the true/false array can be 
	//normalized to that size
	int len = strlen(SW)-1;//stores the word's length in variable len
	//initializing the true/false array
	int answerCheck[MAXLEN];
	for(int i = 0;i < len; ++i ){//intialize counter, while counter is less than len, increment counter
		answerCheck[i]=0;
	}//makes the answerCheck array all have 0's for the length of the SECRET_WORD
	int won = 0; // variable that checks if the player has won or not 0=false, 1 = true
	//implement while loop for the remaining game logic
									
							</code></pre>
							<p>This section of the code governs the core logic of the Hangman game. Initially, the win condition variable is set to False (0), indicating the game is in progress. The primary while loop then activates, continuously checking this win condition. Within this loop, the program examines the `answerCheck` array, which starts as an array of 0's, each representing an unguessed letter in the secret word. If a 0 is encountered, a placeholder (*) is displayed; if a 1 is found, the corresponding letter from the secret word is revealed. For instance, if `answerCheck` is [0,0,1,0] and the secret word is "that," the output to the player would be: **a*.</p>
							<p>Following this, the game prompts the player to guess a letter, storing the input in the `Guess` variable. This guess is then compared against each letter in the secret word. If a match is found, the respective index in `answerCheck` is updated to 1, revealing the letter in subsequent rounds. When all letters are correctly guessed, signaling that `answerCheck` contains no more 0's, the game displays the complete word, congratulates the player, and inquires if they wish to play another round.</p>
							<p>Should the player choose to continue (by not entering 0), the game restarts with a new secret word and the guess counter reset. Entering 0 concludes the game, triggering a farewell message that appreciatively includes the player's name, "Thanks for playing, [player]."</p>
							<pre><code>
    while(won == 0){
	    printf("The word is: ");//printing the first part of the stdout message:
									
	    for(int x = 0; x < len; ++x){

	    //loops through the answercheck array when encountering a 1 which is a true value,
	    //prints the char at the index position of the SECRET_WORD

					<p>
						As this chapter of my programming journey closes, reflecting on the creation of this Hangman game as my inaugural 
						C project fills me with a sense of accomplishment and invaluable learning. Diving into the C language, known for its power and complexity, 
						presented a unique set of challenges and opportunities for growth. Through the development process—from conceptualizing the game's flow to 
						implementing its logic and witnessing the dynamic interaction in the terminal—I've gained a deeper understanding of fundamental programming 
						concepts, memory management, and the importance of efficient code structure.

						This project was more than just writing code; it was about solving problems, thinking critically about functionality and 
						user experience, and learning to navigate the intricacies of a new programming language. The success of this game, marked not only by its 
						functionality but also by the personal growth experienced throughout its development, sets a strong foundation for my future endeavors in software development.
						
						As I move forward, the lessons learned and the confidence gained from this project will undoubtedly influence my approach 
						to future challenges. I look forward to exploring more complex projects and continuing to expand my skills in C and other programming languages. 
						This Hangman game will always serve as a reminder of where I started and how far I can go with determination and a willingness to learn.
