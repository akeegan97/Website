							<p>This mini project was my first project in the C progamming language. The exe file takes a random word from the associated text file and uses that word as the secret word
								players have to guess. In the terminal where the code runs starts by asking for a player's name so it can use that in subsequent printf statements to the terminal. After a player
								successfully guesses the word the program asks them if they would like to play again or end the program. Ending the program is met with a message to the player telling tham thank 
								you for playing "player". Else the program loops to the beginning and chooses a new random word.
							</p>

							<p>This portion of the code handles the initial set up of the program. initializing the max lines and max length of the char array to store the entirety of the
								words.txt file. Next it prints out to the terminal the welcome message, and asks for the player's name. Opening the words.txt file and looping through the file 
								and putting each new line into the words char array. And finally initializing the random number to use as the index value of the char array and storing that value
								as the secret word SW.

	int answerCheck[MAXLEN];
	for(int i = 0;i < len; ++i ){//intialize counter, while counter is less than len, increment counter
		answerCheck[i]=0;
	}//makes the answerCheck array all have 0's for the length of the SECRET_WORD

							<p>This portion of the code handles the logic of the program. Walking through the program first the variable for the win condition is set to 0 or False. Next the while loop 
								for the internal logic is placed. This checks the win condition making sure it is still false once it checks that, the next portion is entered which checks the answerCheck
								array which is initalized to the length of the secret word and made up of all 0's, if it encounters a 0 at the index value it prints a * which represents a still unguessed 
								letter. if a 1 is found it checks the secret word array and returns the letter at the same index location as the true value in the answerCheck array. For a quick example:
								the answerCheck array = [0,0,1,0], and the secret word array has [t,h,a,t], in this loop the same index value as the 1 in answerCheck is displayed to the player, which would
								be a, so the printf line would read: The word is: **a*, each iteration the answerCheck array is checked and the corresponding letter is displayed. The next part of the logic 
								asks the player for a letter stors it in the Guess variable and this Guess char is compared to the secret word, if the char matches the secret word at any position the answerCheck
								variable at that index postion is turned to a 1. Once all characters are guessed the final loop occurs displaying the word, telling the player they won and asking if they want
								to play again. If the player enters anything except a 0 the game is restarted with a new random word and the guess counter is reset to 0. If 1 is input the game ends and sends the final 
								message "Thanks for playing : "player"".
